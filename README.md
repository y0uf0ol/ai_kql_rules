# AI KQL Rules

Welcome to the `ai_kql_rules` GitHub repository, an experimental platform designed to explore the capabilities of GPT-4 in generating Detection rules based on articles and reports within the cybersecurity domain.

## Overview

This project is at the intersection of cutting-edge AI technology and cybersecurity, aiming to automate the generation of detection rules by leveraging the analytical prowess of GPT-4. It represents a novel approach to understanding and responding to the evolving threat landscape by analyzing textual content and generating KQL (Kusto Query Language) rules that can be used for threat detection in environments monitored by tools like Microsoft Defender.

## Disclaimer

Please note that all content in this repository is AI-generated and intended for experimental use only. This project is designed for educational and testing purposes, showcasing the potential of AI in cybersecurity. It is not recommended to directly implement these rules in a production environment without thorough review and testing by cybersecurity professionals.

**Use with Caution**: While this project demonstrates the innovative application of AI, it's essential to approach the generated rules with a critical eye. The accuracy and effectiveness of these rules can vary, and they should be considered as starting points for further refinement.
